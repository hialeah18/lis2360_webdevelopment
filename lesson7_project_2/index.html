            	<h2><em> Overview</em></h2>
                <p> Imagine you're watching a sci-fy movie. The main villian is livestreaming a video of the President's face to the entre country threatening war. The only problem is, the President isn't saying those words. Instead, a computer generated avatar of the President is speaking on his behalf, threatening the safety of the entire world. This situation sounds like something that would only happen in a movie, however, with current technological advancements this scene could eventually play out in the real world. </p>
                
                <p> Deep Fakes are a type of Artificial Intelligence that combines and superimposes images and videos on top of one another using machine learning techniques. In simplier terms, Deep Fakes work by putting someone's face on top of a preexisting video. This results in a new video of that person doing something that never actually occured in reality. It does this by learning the individual's movements and facial expressions and allows the face that is put on top of it to make similar facial expressions. </p>
                
                <p> Originally, this software was only used in Hollywood Blockbusters. If an actor dies or can no longer continue the filming process, the film studio will use computer generated models of said actor so they can still complete the movie. This method has been seen in several notable Hollywood movies such as Rogue One, Fast and the Furious, and even Forrest Gump. Originally this was a multi million dollar process with complex cameras studying the actors facial expressions and movements as well as intense research into past videos of these actors. However, now this technology is in the palm of your hand with new apps coming out that allow the user to use this technique on themselves and others that they know. </p>
                
                <p> The popular social media app Snapchat as well as the popular application FakeApp allow the user to now swap faces with people from thier camera roll, those around them, and even celebrities. Snapchat works by taking the faces of people from a user's camera roll (with user persmission) and placing them on the person in the picture. The face moves with the user's face and sometimes doesn't work becasue of lighting and weird camera angles. However, FakeApp takes this to another level. It superimposes the image on the person no matter what the lighting or angle is. It also moves seamlessly with the user's mouth, the only noticible difference would be the user's voice. </p>
